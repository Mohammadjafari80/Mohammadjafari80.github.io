    <p>
      I am a 22-year-old final-year BSc student at <strong>Sharif University of Technology</strong>, 
      majoring in computer engineering with a specialization in <em>robustness and optimization</em>. 
      A primary focus of my research is the development of reliable and scalable algorithms, 
      with a focus on <strong>robustness and optimization</strong>. 
      As an academic researcher, I am interested in <em>machine learning (ML)
      and deep learning (DL), 
      optimization theory, and algorithm design</em> , 
      aiming to develop solutions that are both efficient and resilient to a variety of challenges. 
      These research topics provide a solid foundation for my current and future research aspirations: 
      developing AI systems that are both <strong>efficient</strong> and <strong>robust</strong>.
